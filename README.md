# Fastml4j
Fast Scala and nd4j based machine learning framework

Done:
* Logistic regression
* Linear regression (ordinary least squares)
* Linear SVM: Hinge Loss with Pegasos SGD
* Classification metrics
* Implicit expressions for nd4j
* Regression metrics
* Migrate to Float 

TODO:

* Port Hinge loss from {1, -1} to {0, 1}
* [Bug] Delete intercept from regulairsation
* Write good tests for linear regression
* Stohastic gradient descent (with replacement and not)
* L1 and L2 regularisation put in traits
* Decision tree
* Write documentation in code
* Boosting: Ada Boost
* Bagging: Random forest
* Gradient boosting trees
* PCA
